# Facebook-like-system
Facebook like system with  PHP OOP, MySQLi, AJAX, Bootstrap.

I made this small project just to demonstrate how you can make Facebook like system with PHP OOP, MySQLi, AJAX and Bootrstrap.

This project use OOP PHP technique. In config folder, open config.php file and enter your database settings. Make new database, insert product or just watch Youtube video tutorials if you doen't know how to make it. I'am usig AJAX for this project, so you can like or unlike products without refreshig a page. You can make user authentication and check if user login on your web app instad of checking hes ip address like i do in this example. If user allready like certain product, then we show him then with fa-fa icon,also showing a number of likes. So user can like just once one product. You can use this like system in any web app.
